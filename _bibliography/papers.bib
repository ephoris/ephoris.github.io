    abstract = {Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees) are increasingly used as
                the storage engines behind several data systems, frequently
                deployed in the cloud. Similar to other database architectures,
                LSM trees consider information about the expected workload
                (e.g., reads vs. writes, point vs. range queries) to optimize
                their performance via tuning. However, operating in a shared
                infrastructure like the cloud comes with workload uncertainty
                due to the fast-evolving nature of modern applications. Systems
                with static tuning discount the variability of such hybrid
                workloads and hence provide an inconsistent and overall
                suboptimal performance.To address this problem, we introduce
                Endure - a new paradigm for tuning LSM trees in the presence of
                workload uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on the impact of
                the choice of compaction policies, size ratio, and memory
                allocation on the overall performance. Endure considers a robust
                formulation of the throughput maximization problem and
                recommends a tuning that maximizes the worst-case throughput
                over the neighborhood of each expected workload. Additionally,
                an uncertainty tuning parameter controls the size of this
                neighborhood, thereby allowing the output tunings to be
                conservative or optimistic. Through both model-based and
                extensive experimental evaluations of Endure in the
                state-of-the-art LSM-based storage engine, RocksDB, we show that
                the robust tuning methodology consistently outperforms classical
                tuning strategies. The robust tunings output by Endure lead up
                to a 5X improvement in throughput in the presence of
                uncertainty. On the flip side, Endure tunings have negligible
                performance loss when the observed workload exactly matches the
                expected one.},

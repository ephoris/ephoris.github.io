I am a PhD candidate working with
[Manos Athanassoulis](https://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/), and an [IBM PhD
Fellowship
Awardee](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html).
My research interests are in performance tuning for data systems, machine
learning for systems, and systems for machine learning. I have been primarily
focusing on exploring methods to incorporate input/workload variability to the
classic database tuning problem.

Prior to Boston University, I grew up in the frozen tundra Minnesota where I
attended the University of Minnesota and graduated Magna Cum Laude. During my
time there I focused on machine learning and neuroscience with [Vladimir
Cherkassky](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/vladimir-cherkassky) and [Bin
He](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/he-bin.html).

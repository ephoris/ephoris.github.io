I am a PhD candidate working with
[Manos Athanassoulis](https://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/) and an [IBM PhD
Fellowship](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html).
My research interests are in performance tuning for data systems, and machine
learning for systems. I have been primarily focusing on exploring methods to
incorporate input/workload variability to the classic database tuning problem.

Prior to Boston University, I grew up in the frozen tundra that is Minnesota.
For undergrad, I attended the University of Minnesota where I
graduated Magna Cum Laude in Computer Engineering. During my time there I
focused on machine learning and neuroscience with [Vladimir
Cherkassky](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/vladimir-cherkassky) and [Bin
He](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/he-bin.html).
